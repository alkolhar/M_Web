To use this repository, the use of [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html) is highly recommended.

## How to use (with XAMPP)
1. Open MySQL Admin Panel
2. Create a `address-book` database
3. Add a users table, that looks like this:<br>

| ID | First_Name  | Last_Name  | Username  | Password  | Last_Login  |
|----|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1  | Alex        | Koller     | Alko      | d41d8cd9e | 28 Nov 2021 |
| 2  |             |            |           |           |             |
| 3  |             |            |           |           |             | 

_Note that the password has to be hashed via php's password hashing function._
